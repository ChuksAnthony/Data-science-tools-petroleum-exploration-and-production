This repo is an extension of the [Predict repository](https://github.com/mycarta/predict) consisting of:
- an expansion and amelioration of the Python significance tests showcased in [Geoscience ML notebook 2](https://github.com/mycarta/predict/blob/master/Geoscience_ML_notebook_2.ipynb) and [Geoscience_ML_notebook 3](https://github.com/mycarta/predict/blob/master/Geoscience_ML_notebook_3.ipynb)
- addition of new tests and examples (eventually with interactive counterparts)
- addition of R tools
